## 服务和娱乐场所 (支持v1.0.X)
<p>添加了两种建筑："风月场所"和仅可以修在城镇和城市的"高级娱乐场所"。这两个建筑分别生产"服务"和"奢靡服务"（请不要试图贸易这两种服务，因为需要的贸易容量非常大）。

<p>士兵、劳工和农民对服务有需求，而市民和贵族对奢靡服务有需求。

<p>此外，添加了在这两个建筑中工作的"艺人"，由农民或奴隶升级而来，这种人口也可能升级为市民。

## Service and Entertainment House (Compatible with v1.0.X)
<p>Two new building types have been added: Pleasure Houses and Grand Entertainment Houses, the latter of which can only be constructed in towns and cities. These buildings produce Services and Luxury Services respectively.

<p>Soldiers, laborers, and peasants demand Services. Burghers and nobles consume Luxury Services.

<p>New pop type: Entertainers. Entertainers work in both 2 types of entertainment buildings and can promote from peasants or slaves. They may also promote further into burghers.

<p>Since EU5 does not support local-only goods, the trade capacity required for both types of Services has been set extremely high in order to discourage trade. Manually trading these goods will waste your trade capacity. Under normal circumstances, with automatic trade enabled, the AI will not trade these Services.
